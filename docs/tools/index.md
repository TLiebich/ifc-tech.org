The IFC ecosystem has produced many tools for working with the schema and schema language formats. Here you can find information about tools that have been produced or adopted by the buildingSMART organisation and links to known tools by platform vendors.

Each tool is included for its functional application within the IFC ecosystem. Tool suites are deconstructed into their component functions for categorization.  

#### IFCdoc

IFCdoc is a tool used to generate IFC schema.
