title: Tools
---

The IFC ecosystem has produced many tools for working with the schema and schema language formats. Here you can find information about tools that have been produced or adopted by the buildingSMART organisation and links to known tools by platform vendors.

Each tool is included for its functional application within the IFC ecosystem. Tool suites are deconstructed into their component functions for categorization.  

#### IFCdoc

IFCdoc is a tool used to generate IFC schema.


#### Below is a list of known tools in the ecosystem.

| Tool Name | Link Docs | Description |
| BimServices | [Go](http://www.aec3.com/en/6/6_04.htm) |  to interoperate between IFC, ifcXML and other representations such as COBIE2 and HTML. Configured using XSLT files. |
| BimServices | [Go](http://www.aec3.com/en/6/6_04.htm) | to reduce an IFC model by filtering out selected objects and relationships. |
| BimServices | [Go](http://www.aec3.com/en/6/6_04.htm)  | to compare tow IFC models from the project downwards. |
| BimServices | [Go](http://www.aec3.com/en/6/6_04.htm)  |  to check an IFC model for compliance against a regulation or requirements. Configured using IFC Constraint models, and user specific dictionaries. |
| IFC SDK | [Go](https://github.com/cstb/ifc-sdk) | The IFC SDK project provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) for reading and writing a Building Information Model (BIM) defined in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. First version of the IFC SDK is provided in C++ programming language and is compliant with IFC 2X3 TC1 standard developed by the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI BuildingSmart, see: http://www.buildingsmart.com/). |
| Stepcode | [Go](http://stepcode.org) | STEPcode (formerly NIST's STEP Class Library) is used with IFC, STEP, and other standards that utilize the technologies of ISO10303 (STEP). It generates C++ and Python from EXPRESS (10303-11) schemas. The code is capable of reading and writing STEP Part 21 exchange files. It also utilizes Parts 22 and 23 (SDAI and its C++ binding).|
| xBIM toolkit | [Go](http://www.openbim.org/) | Written with "open-standards" in mind, xBIM (eXtensible Building Information Modelling) is a free, open-source, software development toolkit that allows developers to create bespoke BIM middle ware for IFC-based applications. |
| BIMserver | [Go](http://www.bimserver.org/) | The Building Information Modelserver (short: BIMserver) enables you to store and manage the information of a construction (or other building related) project. Data are stored in the open standard IFC. Used as a base for many open source and commercial applications. Enterprise stable.  |
| GeometryGymIFC | [Go](https://geometrygym.wordpress.com/) | C# classes to generate and parse OpenBIM IFC files. These classes simultaneously support IFC2x3, IFC4 and Infrastructure proposals for IFC5, and are easily extended for experimental extensions. |
| IFCOpenShell | [Go](IFCOpenShell.org) | Open source IFC library and geometry engine. IfcOpenShell is an open source (LGPL) software library for working with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format. Currently supported IFC releases are IFC2x3 TC1 and IFC4 Add1 |
| pythonOCC | [Go](http://pythonOCC.org) | pythonocc is a python library whose purpose is to provide 3D modeling features. It is intended to developers who aim at developing CAD/PDM/PLM applications. An industrial strength 3D CAD python package |
| IFCPlusPlus | [Go](http://ifcplusplus.com) | IfcPlusPlus is an open source C++ class model, as well as a reader and writer for IFC files in STEP format. Features:Easy and efficient memory management using smart pointers. Parallel reader for very fast parsing on multi-core cpu's Additionally, there's a simple IFC viewer application, using Qt and OpenSceneGraph.It can be used as starting point for all kinds of applications around the open building model standard IFC.|
| Express Engine | [Go](http://exp-engine.sourceforge.net/) | STEP (ISO 10303) development environment which supports the validation of STEP data populations via EXPRESS (ISO 10303-11) schemata and the transformation of STEP data populations from one schema to another via EXPRESS-X (ISO 10303-14) schemata. |
| ifcTools | [Go](http://www.ifctoolsproject.com/) | Java Framework for accessing and visualizing IFC based Building Information Models (is being used in the certification process of IFC 4) |
| JSDAI | [Go](http://www.jsdai.net/) | JSDAI is an Application Programming Interface (API) for reading, writing and runtime manipulation of object oriented data defined by an EXPRESS based data model. Such models are widely used in STEP (ISO 10303), PLIB (ISO 13584) and other ISO, IEC and DIN standards. |
| IFC-gen | [Go](https://github.com/ikeough/IFC-gen) | IFC-gen is a set of tools for generating an IFC library for use in the language of your choice. |
| IFC Open query | [Go](http://ifcquery.com/) | <Description> |
