title: IFC2x2 Overview
---

IFC2x Edition 2, published in May 2003, is the second release of the IFC2x Platform.

It introduced many extensions to better support the building service and structural domain.

Since July 2007 the IFC2x2 release (as all previous releases of IFC) has been superseded by <a href="/docs/reference/schema/ifc2x3-tc1/overview.md">the IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum</a> - it is strongly recommended to download and use IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 from now on.

A link to the official documentation can be found <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/ifc2x3-tc1/ifc2x2/ifc2x2.md">here</a>
An overview of all changes since IFC2x-Add1 is provided <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/ifc2x3-tc1/ifc2x2/change-log.md">here</a>
