title: IFC2x2-Add1 Overview
---

IFC2x Edition 2 Addendum 1, published in Jul 2004, is the second release of the IFC2x Platform.

This version fixes issues from the IFC2x2 release.

Since July 2007 the IFC2x2 release (as all previous releases of IFC) has been superseded by <a href="/docs/reference/schema/ifc2x3-tc1/overview.md">the IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum</a> - it is strongly recommended to download and use IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 from now on.

A link to the official documentation can be found <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/ifc2x3-tc1/ifc2x2-Add1/ifc2x2-Add1.md">here</a>
An overview of all changes since IFC2x2 is provided <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/ifc2x3-tc1/ifc2x2-Add1/change-log.md">here</a>
