title: IFC2x3 Overview 
---

IFC2x Edition 3, published in Feb 2006, is the third release of the IFC2x Platform.

The IFC2x3 release is a successor of IFC2x2 Edition 2. IFC2x3 is mainly a quality improvement release that does not add scope but refinenes IFC2x2.

Since July 2007 the IFC2x3 release has been superseded by <a href="/docs/reference/schema/ifc2x3-tc1/overview.md">the IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum</a> - a fully upward and downward compatible corrigendum with mainly documentation improvements. It is strongly recommended to download and use IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 from now on.

A link to the official documentation can be found <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/ifc2x3-tc1/ifc2x3/ifc2x3.md">here</a>
An overview of all changes since IFC2x is provided <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/ifc2x3-tc1/ifc2x3/change-log.md">here</a>
