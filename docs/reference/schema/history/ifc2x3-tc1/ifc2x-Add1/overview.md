title: IFC2x-Add1 Overview
---

The IFC2x Addendum 1, published in October 2001, is an addendum to fix issues that came up during implementation of IFC2x. This release has been used for IFC2x implementation and certification.

The required fixes led to an upward compatible schema change.

A link to the official documentation can be found <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/ifc2x3-tc1/ifc2x-Add1/ifc2x-Add1.md">here</a>

Since July 2007 the IFC2x release (as all previous releases of IFC) has been superseded by <a href="/docs/reference/schema/ifc2x3-tc1/overview.md">the IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum</a> - it is strongly recommended to download and use IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 from now on.

An overview of all changes since IFC2x is provided <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/ifc2x3-tc1/ifc2x-Add1/change-log.md">here</a>
