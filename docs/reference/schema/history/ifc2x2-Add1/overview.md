## IFC2x2-Add1 TC1

<p> IFC2x3 Tc1 is the most up to date version of the IFC2 platform release and is the reference for implementers using the IFC2 standard. Documentation for releases prior to the IFC2x3 tc1 can be found at the bottom of this page (/history) but are no longer officially supported. </p>

<p> IFC2x Edition 2 Addendum 1- small addendum of IFC2x to fix issues that came up during implementation, published in Jul 2004
this release has been used for IFC2x2 implementation and certification
</p>

<p> The initial IFC2x2 release has been published in Mai 2003 as the first successor of the new IFC platform IFC2x. It introduced many extensions to better support the building service and structural domain, e.g. it contains the first IFC sub model for structural analysis, and many extensions for electrical, plumbing and building control definitions. Also the inclusion of 2D content within the model space of a BIM model (line, text, symbols) and presentation information (color, hatching, surface properties, like shading and rendering) are new in IFC2x2.

Issues with the initial IFC2x2 release have been fixed within the IFC2x2 Addendum 1 release, published in July 2004. The required fixes led to an upward compatible schema change. The IFC2x2 Addendum 1 release had been recommended for implementation and certification.

Since July 2007 the IFC2x2 release (as all previous releases of IFC) has been superseded by the IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 - it is strongly recommended to download and use IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 from now on.</p>
