title: IFC4_Add1 Overview
---


The main purposes of the IFC4 Addendum 1 are the improvement of the specification documentation and the necessary enhancements of the schema that resulted from the pilot implementations and the first Model View definitions. All changes made are downward compatible.

The documentation format has been further improved for readability. A language independent section to describe the entities and types with their attributes and relationships is now available and separate to the EXPRESS and XSD code;
The use of concept templates (chapter 4) and concepts is greatly enhanced, based on the mvdXML specification to enable better MVD developments and validation;
Minor schema enhancements reflect the experience from pilot implementations of the IFC4 enhancements;
One additional schema enhancement has been added after intensive discussions and considerations, a simplified and far more compact definition of poly lines with arc segments
See the following <a href="http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/ifc-releases/figures/ifc4-add1-indexedpolycurve-definition">summary</a> of the rationale behind adding this additional geometry definition.

### IFC4 Add 1 for MVD development

the first official Model View Definition for IFC4 will be based on the Addendum 1. Therefore all upcoming buildingSMART International IFC Certification are based on IFC4 Addendum 1.
see IFC4 Reference View and IFC4 Design Transfer View as the first two bSI MVD's based on IFC4 Add1.
 

 

### IFC4 Add 1 under ISO16739
