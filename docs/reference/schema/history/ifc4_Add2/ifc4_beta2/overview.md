## IFC4_beta2

## Release Notes
The purpose of the IFC2x Edition 4 is to enhance the capability of the IFC specification in several areas of building elements, building service elements and structural elements and accompanying basic definitions. It also corrects several known technical problems found since the release of the IFC2x Edition 3 specification and to improve the documentation generally. Some elements that have been deprecated in earlier releases have been removed or adjusted.

## Purpose of the beta 2 release
The beta 2 release is the functionality and major schema change freeze for IFC2x4.

The purpose of publishing the IFC2x4 beta 2 release is to further encourage the international buildingSMART community to provide feedback and issue reports in order to increase quality and implementability of the next IFC release. The focus of the feedback should be to fix still existing bugs and inconsistencies between the various parts of the IFC schema and to improve documentation and to drive out ambiguity in definitions. However no major schema changes are acceptable for the upcoming beta3 and release candidates. Any comments about the ease of use and examples to demonstrate the use of IFC concepts that could be incorporated are highly appreciated.
