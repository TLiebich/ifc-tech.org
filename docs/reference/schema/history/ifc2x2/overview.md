## IFC2x2

<p> IFC2x Edition 2 - second release of the IFC2x Platform, published in May 2003, several extensions of IFC in domain areas </p>

<p>The initial IFC2x2 release has been published in Mai 2003 as the first successor of the new IFC platform IFC2x. It introduced many extensions to better support the building service and structural domain, e.g. it contains the first IFC sub model for structural analysis, and many extensions for electrical, plumbing and building control definitions. Also the inclusion of 2D content within the model space of a BIM model (line, text, symbols) and presentation information (color, hatching, surface properties, like shading and rendering) are new in IFC2x2.

Issues with the initial IFC2x2 release have been fixed within the IFC2x2 Addendum 1 release, published in July 2004. The required fixes led to an upward compatible schema change. The IFC2x2 Addendum 1 release had been recommended for implementation and certification.

Since July 2007 the IFC2x2 release (as all previous releases of IFC) has been superseded by the IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 - it is strongly recommended to download and use IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 from now on.</p>
