## IFC2x3 TC1

<p>  IFC2x Edition 3 - third release of the IFC2x Platform, published in Feb 2006, mainly quality improvement of IFC2x2 </p>

<p>The IFC2x3 release has been published in Feb 2006 as a successor of IFC2x2 Edition 2. It soon has been established as the common ground of IFC implementations, combining previous IFC2x and IFC2x2 implementation threads. IFC2x3 is mainly a quality improvement release not adding scope but refinements on top of IFC2x2.

Since July 2007 the IFC2x3 release has been superseded by the IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 - a fully upward and downward compatible corrigendum with mainly documentation improvements. It is strongly recommended to download and use IFC2x3 Technical Corrigendum 1 from now on.</p>

<p> IFC2x3 Tc1 is the most up to date version of the IFC2 platform release and is the reference for implementers using the IFC2 standard. Documentation for releases prior to the IFC2x3 tc1 can be found <a href="/docs/reference/schema/history/overview.md"> here</a> but are no longer officially supported. </p>
