title: Express Overview
---

The IFC specification is written using the EXPRESS data definition language, defined as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-11">ISO10303-11</a> by the <a href="http://www.tc184-sc4.org/">ISO TC184/SC4 committee</a>. It is the same data definition language as used e.g. in STEP or CIS/2. It has the advantage of being compact and well suited to include data validation rules within the data specification. The IFC exchange file structure (the syntax of the IFC data file with suffix ".ifc") is the so called "STEP physical file" format, defined as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21">ISO10303-21</a> by the same ISO TC184/SC4 committee. It is an ASCII file format used to exchange IFC between different applications.
