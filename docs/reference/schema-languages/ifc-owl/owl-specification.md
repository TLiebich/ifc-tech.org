Converting IFC to OWL can be done on different ways. A unidirectional conversion from an IFC to an OWL has been developed for research purposes. The developed prototype converts not all the IFC data to OWL but supports the search for a more appropriate mapping. As the conversion is not straightforward, reengineering the building model to gain more advantages of functionality offered by OWL has to be investigated.
